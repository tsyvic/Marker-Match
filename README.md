https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veb050MIlOfql4BvOjlP0i9BGXySr2pANCXyf_Xoj9E/edit#

Our project is a web application which streamlines the process of applying to become a marker/tutor for students. They are able sumbit an application and view the progress in their applications tab. We have 3 main views which are a student view, a course coordinator view and a marker/tutor coordinator view.

Student View
1) select all the courses they want to mark/tutor for.
2) submit an application to become a marker or tutor for any course
3) have the ability to check the status of their application
4) see more detailed information about the courses they have been accepted into for marking or tutoring.

Marker/Tutor Coordinator View
1) Should be able to specify a minimum required grade for marking or tutoring a course
2) Manage who is qualified to mark and tutor a course
3) Ability to see all applicants for all courses
4) Assign markers and tutors to a course
5) email all markers/tutors as well as all course coordinators

Course Coordinator View
1) Edit course information for the marker/tutor admin to view
2) Rank their own preference for markers and tutors for the course.

<h1>Potential Use Cases</h1>
Use Case 1:  A student wants to apply to become a marker or tutor for a course
When a user first opens the web application they are shown a homepage and can click on the “apply now” button which will show them to the google O-auth page. They must enter a university email address otherwise they will not be granted access. once they put their email address in they will be taken to the sso login page. They can login to sso from here and will then be able to access the website. (note that if a user has already logged in before they will be taken directly to the courses pages on the website).
The user can then search through the courses using the course search function and then click to apply to become a marker or tutor for the course.
They can then fill out the form and once that is complete they will be able to submit their application (note that students are able to submit multiple applications at once in order to make the process easier and more efficient).<br><br>

Use case 2: A student wants to check the status of their applications
Assuming that a student has already logged in they will be able to click on the “My Applications” tab on the website and see all their applications.
They can also filter all their applications by going to the different tabs on the page. There is a “pending”, “accepted” and “rejected” tab so they can filter to see which ones are successful or not or if they are still waiting for the result.
  
Use case 3: The marker/tutor coordinator wants to select students for marking and tutoring
The marker and tutor coordinator are able to login the same way as students are but they will be presented with an administrative view.
The user can then select the course for which they want markers and tutors for and then they will be able to select students they think are suitable candidates by accepting their applications. They can reject students as well who they don’t think are qualified enough.

<h1>How we can enhance it in the future</h1>
In the future we could extend the functionality by adding in the Hungarian algorithm so that we can automatically have markers and tutors assigned to each course instead of admin having to manually go through each course and selecting tutors they feel would be the best fit.

Another feature we could potentially add in the future would be to allow for full mobile support. Currently our application does scale with screen size but to be even more friendly we could create a separate mobile application using something like swift or kotlin that way users would easily be able to apply for courses using their phone and easily be able to track their progress. If we were to go through this route we could also add widgets for the application. An example would be for us to have a widget of the applications section of our application. This would allow students to easily check the status of their current applications without even having to open up our app.

Again another feature that we could add would be to add a dark mode setting to the application where we change the colour scheme of the application based on the users preference and to go even further we could add colour blind settings for people who are colour blind. We would add a list of different colour blind settings e.g. protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia. This would allow our application to become more user friendly and incline people to use our application and be satisfied while using it.

Another feature we found that could be beneficial in the future would be to add an in app messaging system. This would allow students who may have some questions before applying to mark or tutor a course to be able to directly message the course coordinator through an in-app messaging system and get a reply much easier. Usually students would have to wait for an email but with a messaging system built in we would be able to see different things such as if the other person has seen the message or not. It is also very beneficial for those who are already tutors and markers as we could allow students who are marking and tutoring the same course to message each other or even have a group messaging chat on the application itself so they can keep each other informed on how things are going or if they need any help with anything they can help each other out.

We also think that a course recommendation feature would be a great addition to our web application. In the future students would be able to get automatically recommended courses that they should mark or tutor based on specific criteria such as overall gpa, their specific grades for each course and other such factors. This would make it much easier for students to apply as they don’t have to filter through courses themselves which they think would be best for them they can just easily apply.

Another feature we felt was useful to add to our application was a remuneration management system. This would allow students to track their payments and see if they have been given the correct amount easily and see other different things such as total payment made to date, their future payments and other useful information. It would also be an easy way for the admin to track the payments being made and make sure they are not over or under paying the staff. Although There could be other options available, having one system which has the ability to manage everything relating to marking and tutoring would be very beneficial and make it much easier as they don’t have to use several different applications and everything they need is all in one application.

Finally the last feature we think would be greatly beneficial for this application would be to add a rating feature and comment section for courses. This would essentially allow students who have previously marked or tutored for a course to give it a rating out of 5 stars and also write a comment on their experience. This would help a lot for future students as they would be able to gain some insight on what it would be like to be a marker or tutor for each course and further help them in making the decision on whether or not they want to become a marker or a tutor. It would also allow the course coordinators to make their course more friendly towards students as these reviews also double up as feedback to the course coordinators and they will be able to improve their course from this feedback.
